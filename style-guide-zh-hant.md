何時使用 BURST, Burst 和 `burst`
--------------------------------

**BURST** 是貨幣代碼. 舉例來說 “我們擁有足夠的 BURST/BTC 交易所, 但我們需要一個 BURST/fiat gateway.”

**Burst** 是指網路。 舉例來說 “Burst不僅僅是一種發送數字貨幣的方式，它還是一個軟體框架，圍繞該框架可以建立以數字貨幣為基礎的大量網路業務。”

**** is a unit of the currency. e.g. “I'm a ~~poor shibe~~ small stakeholder with only 4399 , if someone could give me 601 , I'd have a nice round number.”

Omit needless words
-------------------

Being succinct is being clear. And an easy way to be succinct is to omit needless words. [1]. For instance,

“...average Bitcoin transaction time has significantly increased to the 8-to-13 minute range...”

can be simplified to

“...average Bitcoin transaction time has significantly increased to 8 to 13 minutes...”
