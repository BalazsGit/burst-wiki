Description
-----------

Burst has a permanent TestNet running. Its purpose is to provide a sandbox for both developers and users to test Burst features and to experiment with features without remorse[1]. To talk about the testnet, visit us in <https://discord.gg/UnwXKB> in the channel \#testnet

How to set up a TestNet node ?
------------------------------

Please follow the instructions [outlined here in BAT's git repository](https://github.com/burst-apps-team/BurstcoinTestNetHow-To).[2] Obviously, you should use a different DB for TestNet than you use for MainNet.
