Burst официально был представлен на форуме bitcointalk [10-го августа 2014 года](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=731923.0) с целью решить типичные проблемы, свойственные прочим криптовалютам:

-   Недостаток децентрализации
-   Излишний расход электричества
-   Несправедливое распределение
-   Преобладание крупных майнеров и корпораций

It is the first and only cryptocurrency secured by a Proof-of-Capacity algorithm. The critical difference between Proof of Work and Burst’s Proof of Capacity (PoC) is that instead of needing ever more expensive, power hungry processors and graphic cards, it uses inexpensive, low-power hard drives.

### Decentralization

Burst addresses the problem of centralist tendencies that plague other cryptocurrencies by providing an ASIC-proof algorithm that utilizes standard off-the-shelf hardware accessible to everyone: hard drives in regular PCs

### Energy-Efficient

Burst requires per transaction about 1/400th of energy compared to bitcoin[1], this makes Burst not only an eco-friendly green coin, it also means you can use very low-end hardware to mine it. You can mine Burst with something as small as Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone black.

### Fair Release

Burst was released without premine[2], [ICO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering) or Airdrops. All Burst in existence today, have been mined with the PoC algorithm.

### Equal Opportunities

Because there is no need to buy expensive, specialized and often hard-to-get hardware, Burst is potentially accessible to everyone who owns a PC. And no matter how well funded some individual or organization is, they cannot outcompete regular miners with some specialized hardware.
