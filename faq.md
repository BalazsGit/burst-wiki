### **What is Burst?**

Burst is a blockchain platform with multiple core-level features that has been running publicly since August 2014. It is a fork of Nxt and it's 100% Proof of Capacity (PoC) , meaning that you can mine it with your disk space. The more disk space you assign to mining, the higher chances you have of processing the next block. Because contrary to Proof-of-Work (PoW) this hardly needs computational resources, a full node can run on something as light as a Raspberry Pi. There will be a total of 2,158,812,800 Burst coins mined around the year 2033.
