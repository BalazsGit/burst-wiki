(\*) **Attention!** Bittrex requires the target address to have a public key activated on the blockchain before they will send send coins. Activating a public key on the block chain usually requires having made an outgoing transaction from the target address. If you do not have BURST to make that outgoing transaction (vicious circle - right?), simply look for a faucet or ASK someone for a few. See FAQ 1.
