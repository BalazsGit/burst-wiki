When to use BURST, Burst and `burst`
------------------------------------

**BURST** is the currency code. e.g. “We have enough BURST/BTC exchanges, but we need a BURST/fiat gateway.”

**Burst** is the network. e.g. “Burst is not merely a way to send digital currency, it's the software framework around which a large variety of interconnected services, based around the digital currency, can be built.”

**** is a unit of the currency. e.g. “I'm a ~~poor shibe~~ small stakeholder with only 4399 , if someone could give me 601 , I'd have a nice round number.”

Omit needless words
-------------------

Being succinct is being clear. And an easy way to be succinct is to omit needless words. [1]. For instance,

“...average Bitcoin transaction time has significantly increased to the 8-to-13 minute range...”

can be simplified to

“...average Bitcoin transaction time has significantly increased to 8 to 13 minutes...”
