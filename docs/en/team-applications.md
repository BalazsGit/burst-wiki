Scope of activities:

-   development of application stack above core
-   development of services above infra
-   app-development-specific support (new developers)

Application Stack
-----------------

Burstcoin real-world usage and adoption is not driven by the most basic software stack only.

Having a wallet is of course important and nice, as is having a complete mining software stack. However, if Burstcoin is not to be just a mining-only and speculation coin, we need to bring it's usage into the real-world/real-economy by doing lots of integration work *on top* of our wallet, APIs and libraries.

One of the most desirable real-world interactions of Burstcoin right now is to have it easily available for purchase/selling against Fiat currencies, to be able to buy and sell them at cryptocurrency-aware ATMs - world wide.

Also, having Burstcoin accepted by merchants is a top priority. While this could be seen in the domain of the Evangelists Team, the tools and software must be present in order to have something to evangelize about at all.

Services above Infra
--------------------

We're building up a thorough infrastructure for Burstcoin and applications or integration efforts with added value on top of this infrastructure is what will bring Burstcoin to the real economy. E.g. making use of the explorer API (https://explore.burst.cryptoguru.org/api) and also specifying desired/useful extensions to it in cooperation with the core team is one of the building activities above infra.

Same applies to many other services available which - while they may be not Burstcoin specific - still provide useful infrastructure to build our Burstcoin-specific services upon. e.g.

-   <https://www.coingecko.com/api/docs/v3>
-   <https://www.cryptocompare.com/api/>
-   <https://www.coinapi.io/>

etc.

App-Development Support
-----------------------

App-Development is a broad field requiring coverage of a plethora of programming languages and technologies. This in turn translates to lots of development resources required and this means ideally a large developer inflow.

While new developers may be very competent in their respective field, they will naturally lack the Burstcoin-specific knowledge needed for their integration efforts. Transferring this Know-How to them, on the other hand, may be too specific and too technical for the support team to handle, which is why the application team should develop a culture of the more senior devs spending a part of their time helping out the new devs. This is the only way to scale.
