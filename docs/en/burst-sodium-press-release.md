On May 10, 2020, version 2.5.0 of the Burst Reference Software (BRS) for the Burstcoin blockchain will be released. Active nodes running the new version will automatically participate in a hard fork of the Burst blockchain around the **June 20, 2020, at blockheight 765,000**. Codenamed *SODIUM*, the hard fork will unlock new platform-wide features, better performance, and security improvements. To unleash more of Burstcoin’s potential, the Burst Apps Team is seeking fast, network-wide adoption of this new release.

## Bursting into the next decade

The *SODIUM* protocol modifications contain **updated smart contracts**, allowing for 50 times larger complexity, with lower fees. Combined with the BlockTalk Java Smart Contract compiler, these changes usher in the next chapter of trustless projects (DeFi, Non-Fungible Tokens, DEXs, Games, etc).

Among further fixes and upgrades, the consensus protocol has been reinforced with stricter fee regulations, which ensures the consensus is fairly enforced for miners. Further, a new logarithmic time constant will determine when blocks are accepted on the blockchain. This gives everyone a more predictable timespan for transactions to be validated, and is **much closer to the target 4 minutes per block**. It **improves security** for both miners and users.

In the second half of 2020, BRS 3.0 an **open-source rewrite of the core software** from Java to Kotlin will be released. It represents a faster and more energy efficient future for Burstcoin and includes the hard fork protocol changes comprising *SODIUM*.

Phoenix, an open source **cross-platform Burst Wallet UI** will be included in BRS 3.0 as default web wallet. It provides multiple account management, improved security, and better interoperability between Burst applications, making it easy for developers to expand on the Burstcoin platform.

*SODIUM*, BRS 2.5 and BRS 3.0 together represent over a year’s worth of work for the Burst Apps Team. Through rigorous testing, reviews, and iterations, they have been preparing for this event for months, and are **actively calling out to all Burstcoiners to update their nodes**.

*The Burst Apps Team has been preparing the Burst blockchain since early 2019 for the next decade. Increasing speed, stability and functionality, a new software version combined with an upcoming hard fork will solidify Burstcoin once again as a next-generation cryptocurrency. The open-source Burstcoin blockchain was first developed in 2014 and has been at the forefront of blockchain technology with the first implementation of smart contracts. Burst is the pioneer of the “Proof of Capacity” consensus algorithm, a green alternative to Proof of Work.*
