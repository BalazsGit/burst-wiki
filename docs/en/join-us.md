**Contributing**

Burst is a community project. Everyone's welcome to contribute to this wiki. We are always in the process of keeping this wiki as up to date as possible. Most of the content was transferred to this site from an older wiki version, but formatting was incorrectly displayed in some areas and a lot of things were missing, such as a couple months worth of updated pages, translations and images.

We would greatly appreciate any contributions, whether it be fixing existing content or writing new content. Feel free to fork the repo, make your changes and then open a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/burst-apps-team/burst-wiki).

Many of us hang out and collaborate over at [Discord](https://discord.gg/PMUgVSY). Come join us!
