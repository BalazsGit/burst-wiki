Introduction
------------------------

Burst has many traits from many different “fathers”, so it's not possible to list just one white paper. Below you will find a list of related white papers.

The most recent and most constituent white paper on Burst is [The Burst Dymaxion](https://www.burst-coin.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/The-Burst-Dymaxion-1.00.pdf), describing the concept and implementation of a layer to the Burst blockchain which will be capable of sustaining the total global load of non-cash transactions.

Nxt White Paper
---------------------

Burst started as a fork of [Nxt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nxt). Below you will find the Nxt community white paper[1].

There was a substantial modification to the fork by carving out Proof-of-Stake (PoS) completely and replacing it with PoC (Proof-of-Capacity). 

Other Proof of Capacity White Papers
----------------------------
A similar concept to Proof of Capacity is called Proof of Space and was described 2013 in the Proofs of Space paper [2] by Dziembowski, Faust, Kolmogorov and Pietrzak.

Based on this paper, a Proof-of-Space cryptocurrency “SpaceMint” was proposed[3] in a paper by Sunoo Park, Kwon, Fuchsbauer, Pietrzak et al.

Both of these papers (“Proof of Space” and “SpaceMint”) are only mentioned as a loose reference and because the SpaceMint paper refers to BURST.
