A [smart contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) is a computer protocol intended to facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts were first proposed by Nick Szabo in 1996.

In Burst, smart contracts are implemented as so called [Automated Transactions](automated-transaction.md), or short ATs.
