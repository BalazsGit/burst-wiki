### 1.3 **Security Tips**

-   When creating a Burst account, if you design your own passphrase, ONLY USE a high security passphrase (50+ characters, truly random, including upper case and lower case letters, numbers and symbols). Your Burst **WILL** eventually be stolen if you don't use a secure passphrase! [Here's how to choose a strong password.](https://burstwiki.org/wiki/Secure_Your_Burst)
-   Burst's peer-to-peer communications port is 8123(tcp). This port is the only port that needs to be open to run Burst.
