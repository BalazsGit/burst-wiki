Introduction
============

Reward assignment is frequently used when pool mining. When changing your reward assignment, you tell the network that another account (the pool account) is acting in your place for 2 specific features. The first feature is that all block rewards that should be given to your account will now be given to the pool account instead. Secondly, for the pool to be able to utilize the deadlines found from your plot files, it is also granted the action to sign the newly forged blocks with the account belonging to the pool.
