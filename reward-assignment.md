Introduction
============

Reward assignment is used to facilitate pool mining. A reward assignment notifies the network that all block rewards attributed to your plot files while mining are to be given to another account (the pool account) which is acting in your place. It grants permission for blocks that are forged using the deadlines that you submit to a pool to be signed with the account belonging to that pool.
