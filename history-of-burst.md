Spam Attack and Network Forks
=============================

On July 22nd of 2017 an attacker spammed the Burst network with messages, causing wallets to crash and splitting the network into multiple forks [14]. The network remained unstable for several days. As a result the Poloniex exchange froze the coin and disabled deposits and withdrawls . By August 10th the network was stable again and Poloniex reactived Burst deposits and withdrawls .

Formation of the PoC Consortium
===============================

In the aftermath of the spam attack a group of Burst enthusiasts formed the [Proof-of-Capacity Consortium (PoCC)](poc-consortium.md). The original announcement of the group was posted on the third anniversary of the Burst blockchain on August 11th of 2017[15]. Inital activities of the group included improving the wallet software and providing a reliable block explorer.
