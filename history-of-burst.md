Warning: This article is in a very early state of development and covers only little of Burst's history. Please help extending this article.

There are several important events in the short history of Burst.

Beginning
=========

-   2014-08-20: First pool available

Spam Attack and Network Forks
=============================

On July 22nd of 2017 an attacker spammed the Burst network with messages, causing wallets to crash and splitting the network into multiple forks [3]. The network remained unstable for several days. As a result the Poloniex exchange froze the coin and disabled deposits and withdrawls . By August 10th the network was stable again and Poloniex reactived Burst deposits and withdrawls .

Formation of the PoC Consortium
===============================

In the aftermath of the spam attack a group of Burst enthusiasts formed the Proof-of-Capacity Consortium (PoCC). The original announcement of the group was posted on the third anniversary of the Burst blockchain on August 11th of 2017[4]. Inital activities of the group included improving the wallet software and providing a reliable block explorer.
