Warning: This article is in a very early state of development and covers only little of Burst's history. Please help extending this article.

There are several important events in the short history of Burst.

Beginning
=========

-   2014-08-10: Official announcement on Bitcointalk.org [1]
-   2014-08-20: First pool available

Spam Attack and Network Forks
=============================

On July 22nd of 2017 an attacker spammed the Burst network with messages, causing wallets to crash and splitting the network into multiple forks. The network remained unstable for several days. As a result the Poloniex exchange froze the coin and disabled deposits and withdrawls.

Formation of the PoC Consortium
===============================

In the aftermath of the spam attack a group of Burst enthusiasts formed the Proof-of-Capacity Consortium (PoCC). The original announcement of the group was posted on the third anniversary of the Burst blockchain on August 11th of 2017[2]. Inital activities of the group included improving the wallet software and provided a reliable block explorer.
