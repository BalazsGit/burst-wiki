Introduction
============

A consequent number of developers and community members contributed to the Burst ecosystem. The main objective of this page is to present the different teams/contributors of Burst.

These contributors are sorted according to [this Burstcoinist article](https://www.burstcoin.ist/2018/06/23/the-economy-of-scale-next-steps-for-burst/) (cf. Consensus) and other sources (Burstwiki, Github, Reddit, etc.).

PoC Consortium
==============

Burst was created and launched by an anonymous but highly ambitious developer in August 2014. After a year, he disappeared without explanation, leaving the community to take over development and resources. The coin picked up some momentum in 2016 and 2017, but never truly received the attention and care it deserved.

During summer 2017, the PoC Consortium, a new team of developers, came to Burst to lead it to its rightful place. The PoC Consortium is a group of highly skilled and well funded individuals: executives, entrepreneurs, developers, computer scientists, admins, designers, investors and college students.

Since then, the PoC Consortium has completely transformed the landscape and offered a new future to the coin by releasing the Burst Dymaxion. They are also actively developing and maintaining different softwares that form a good percentage of all tools used [in the Burst ecosystem](burst-software.md). An non-exhaustive list as well as a small description of its member is available [here](https://www.burst-coin.org/contributors).
