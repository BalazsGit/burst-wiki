As of block height 500.000 the Burst blockchain supports, on top of ordinary transactions (one sender to one recipient), sending Burst from one account to multiple recipients in a single transaction. The first Pre-Dymaxion hard fork enabled using amounts below 1 Burst as transaction amounts and transaction fees.

### Ordinary Transactions

Ordinary Burst transactions are one-to-one transactions i.e. one sender sends Burst to one recipient. They can be issued through the local or web wallet.

To issue an ordinary transaction, the sender will specify the Burst account of the recipient, the amount of the transaction and the transaction fee. ![](1_Ordinary_transaction_-_basic.png "fig:1_Ordinary_transaction_-_basic.png") Optionally, users can add an arbitrary message to each outgoing transaction, which can be encrypted, in case of which the content of the message will be visible only to the recipient.

The transaction will be issued by clicking the “Send BURST” button.

#### Advanced options

-   Deadline
-   Referenced transaction hash
-   Do not broadcast
-   Add note to self

### Multi-out Transactions

Multi-out transactions allow the sender to send Burst to up to 64 unique recipient accounts as a single transaction i.e. with considerably lower fee compared to sending the same amount through 64 ordinary transactions.

Same as with ordinary transactions, multi-out transactions can be issued through local or web Burst wallets. ![Multi out](2_Multi_out.png "fig:Multi out")
