# Contributing

We are currently in the process of building up this new version of the wiki in order to replace the Mediawiki-based site. All of the old content has been transferred to this site, but formatting is incorrectly displayed in some areas and a lot of things are missing, such as translations and images.

We would greatly appreciate any contributions, whether it be fixing existing content or writing new content. Feel free to fork the repo, make your changes and then open a pull request.
