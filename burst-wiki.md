Burst: the 'cryptocurrency 2.0'
-------------------------------

Burst was officially introduced on the [10th of August 2014](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=731923.0) with a goal to solve the largest problems faced by other cryptocurrencies:

-   lack of decentralization
-   unsustainable waste of energy
-   unfair pre-mines and ICO releases
-   supremacy of corporate interests and large mining operations

Burst is the first and only cryptocurrency secured by the energy efficient Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) algorithm. Bitcoin and many other “altcoins” use the unsustainable and environmentally disastrous Proof-of-Work algorithm. The critical difference is that Proof-of-Work requires power hungry processors, graphics cards, or expensive application-specific integrated circuits (ASICS) to needlessly and yet repeatedly perform hashing functions in real time to provide security. Burst’s Proof-of-Capacity algorithm provides the same security using regular computer resources and inexpensive hard drives to store and retrieve the results of hashing functions that have been pre-computed.

### Decentralization

Burst addresses the centralist tendency problem plaguing other cryptocurrencies by further using an algorithm that is ASIC-proof. With no possibility for ASICs to out compete regular hardware, continued decentralization is assured.

### Energy-Efficient

Per transaction, Burst uses an estimated 1/400th of the energy required to process bitcoin[1], this makes Burst an eco-friendly coin. It can be mined using something as small as a Raspberry Pi.

### Fair Release

Burst was released with advance public notice, without premine[2], [ICO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering) and without airdrops. All Burst in existence today has been mined beginning with the genesis block using the PoC algorithm.

### Equal Opportunities

Because there is no need to buy expensive specialized hardware, Burst is and will remain accessible to anyone who owns a personal computer. No matter how well funded an individual or organization, they cannot use expensive equipment to gain advantage over regular miners using regular computer equipment.
